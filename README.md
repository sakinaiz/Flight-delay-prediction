# Flight delay - Prediction
In this project, I propose a flight delay prediction model which would be a great add-on feature for websites like FlightStats.com. Passengers can use this handy tool a few months before their trip all the way to the day of the trip to have a hassle-free air travel.

Read my [report](Flight%20Delay%20Project%20Report.pdf) for the problem statement, overview of my analysis and results
